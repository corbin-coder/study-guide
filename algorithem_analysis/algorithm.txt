An algorithm should have:
1: Correctness
2: Efficiency
2a) Time-Complexity, how fast the result is provided by the algorithm
2b) Space-Complexity, how much ram the algorithm is going to consume

Five steps for solving algorithm design questions
1: Constraints
2: Idea Generation
3: Complexities
4: Coding
5: Testing
